VE
---
VE effectively is shortest hand for 'VulkanEdge'. The goal: have a speedy method to create games in C# using Vulkan.

Author: edg3

The goal is to have a easily reusable layer of an engine between existing Vulkan interaction in C# and your own game ideas. Originally this is to bring back my old games on many platforms in Vulkan, and in the future will lead to the new games I am slowly designing and creating.

Uses:
---
Silk.NET - https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET
=> Vulkan - https://www.vulkan.org/

Plans:
---
Starting up:
1. Set up Silk.NET through VE on Windows in C# for a Vulkan Window
2. Bring my original RapidXNA ideas into VE for better state management, input handling, and new ideas I might have (see: images\00.origins\my-rapidxna-back-in-2012.png)
3. Create 'Proof of Concept' rebuilt game from my past 'SokoBomber' as 'mini game' for my new design
4. Make sure it works on Windows, Mac, Linux, try check other devices/hardware if possible
