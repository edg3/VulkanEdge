VE

VE effectively is shortest hand for 'VulkanEdge'. The goal: have a speedy method to create games in C# using Vulkan with OpenGL as backup.

Author: edg3

The goal is to have a easily reusable layer of an engine between existing Vulkan interaction in C# and your own game ideas. Originally this is to bring back my old games on many platforms in Vulkan, and in the future will lead to the new games I am slowly designing and creating.
